# Overview of Supply Chain Security Tools for Tanzu – Store

This topic gives you an overview of Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) – Store.

SCST - Store stores the metadata generated by supply chains in Tanzu Application Platform. It
consists of two services: Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) and the Metadata Store.

## <a id='amr'></a> Artifact Metadata Repository

AMR includes both AMR Observer and AMR CloudEvent Handler.

### <a id='observer'></a> AMR Observer

AMR Observer is a set of managed controllers that monitors for relevant updates on resources of
interest. When relevant events are observed, a CloudEvent is generated and sent to AMR CloudEvent
Handler. You can deploy this component on Full, Build, and Run profile clusters.

### <a id='handler'></a> AMR CloudEvent Handler

AMR CloudEvent Handler receives CloudEvents and stores relevant information in Artifact Metadata
Repository or the Metadata Store. You can deploy this component on Full and View profile clusters.
