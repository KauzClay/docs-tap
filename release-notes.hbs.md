### <a id='1-10-0-breaking-changes'></a> v1.10.0 Breaking changes

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='bitnami-services-bc'></a> v1.10.0 Breaking changes: Bitnami Services

- Bitnami Services are now created by default in the same namespace as the original claim rather
  than in a new dedicated namespace. You can configure this by using the `claim_namespace` package value.

  Existing instances that use the default behaviour are unaffected unless the user has overriden
  `compositionUpdatePolicy` to `Automatic` or altered the `compositionRevisionRef`.
  In that case, the the Bitnami instances will be recreated when the package is upgraded.
  To prevent instances being recreated, you can set the Bitnami package values to `shared_namespace=""`
  and `claim_namespace=False`, which was the previous default.
