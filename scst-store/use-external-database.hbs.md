# Use external PostgreSQL database for Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

This topic describes how you configure Tanzu Application Platform to use an
external database.

For production deployments, VMware recommends you use an external PostgreSQL database rather than the
one packaged with Tanzu Application Platform. This allows you to manage the external database using
the best practices and processes that your organization has established.

## <a id='prereqExtrenalDB'></a>Prerequisites

Gather the following connection information for the external PostgreSQL database:

- Database Instance Connect Endpoint
- CA Certificate for the database instance TLS certificate (if applicable)
- Database credentials
- Name of the database

If migrating from the internal database to an external database, back up the data before proceeding.

## Configure Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) and Metadata Store (MDS) to use the external database

To configure Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) and Metadata Store (MDS) to use the external database:

1. Update your `tap-values.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   metadata_store:
     db_host: "<DB Instance Endpoint>"
     db_user: "<Master Username>"
     db_password: "<Master Password>"
     db_name: "<Database Name>"
     # SEE NOTE BELOW
     # Disable the internal database deployment
     deploy_internal_db: "false"
     db_port: "5432"
     db_max_open_conns: 10
     db_max_idle_conns: 100
     db_conn_max_lifetime: 60
     # If TLS is enabled on PostgreSQL Instance
     db_sslmode: "verify-full"
     # If TLS Certificate is self-signed
     db_ca_certificate: |
       <Corresponding CA Certification>
       ...
       ...
       ...
   ```

   > **Note** If you initially deployed Tanzu Application Platform with an internal database and
   are migrating to an external database, be aware that setting `deploy_internal_db` to `false,`
   removes the internal instance of PostgreSQL. Back up and migrate your data to the database before
   setting this value to false or it might cause data loss.

2. Apply the new configuration:

   ```console
   tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v {{ vars.tap_version }}  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
   ```

3. (Optional) If you are migrating from the internal database to an external database, the
reconciliation might fail. You must manually delete the secret the
cert-manager created and cycle the AMR and MDS Services so that the new secret is picked up.

   ```console
   kubectl delete secret -n metadata_store postgres-db-tls-cert
   kubectl rollout restart -n metadata_store deployment metadata_store-app
   ```

## Validation

Use Bitnami PostgreSQL to verify. For more information, see the [Bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql) documentation.
