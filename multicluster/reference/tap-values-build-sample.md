# Build profile

The following is the YAML file sample for the build-profile:

```yaml
profile: build
ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.
buildservice:
  kp_default_repository: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO"
  kp_default_repository_username: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME"
  kp_default_repository_password: "KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD"
supply_chain: testing_scanning
ootb_supply_chain_testing_scanning:
  registry:
    server: "SERVER-NAME"
    repository: "REPO-NAME"
  gitops:
    ssh_secret: "SSH-SECRET-KEY"
grype:
  namespace: "MY-DEV-NAMESPACE" # (optional) Defaults to default namespace.
  targetImagePullSecret: "TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET"
  metadataStore:
    url: METADATA-STORE-URL-ON-VIEW-CLUSTER
    caSecret:
        name: store-ca-cert
        importFromNamespace: metadata-store-secrets
    authSecret:
        name: store-auth-token
        importFromNamespace: metadata-store-secrets
scanning:
  metadataStore:
    url: "" # Disable embedded integration since it's deprecated
```

Where:

- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Examples:
  * Harbor has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`
  * Dockerhub has the form `kp_default_repository: "my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `kp_default_repository: "index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`
  * Google Cloud Registry has the form `kp_default_repository: "gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-USERNAME` is the user name that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential.
  * For Google Cloud Registry, use `kp_default_repository_username: _json_key`
- `KP-DEFAULT-REPO-PASSWORD` is the password for the user that can write to `KP-DEFAULT-REPO`. You can `docker push` to this location with this credential. This credential can also be configured by using a Secret reference. For more information, see [Install Tanzu Build Service](../../tanzu-build-service/install-tbs.html#install-secret-refs) for details.
  * For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account JSON file.
- `SERVER-NAME` is the host name of the registry server. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `server: "my-harbor.io"`.
    * Dockerhub has the form `server: "index.docker.io"`.
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `server: "gcr.io"`.
- `REPO-NAME` is where workload images are stored in the registry.
Images are written to `SERVER-NAME/REPO-NAME/workload-name`. Examples:
    * Harbor has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`.
    * Dockerhub has the form `repository: "my-dockerhub-user"`.
    * Google Cloud Registry has the form `repository: "my-project/supply-chain"`.
- `SSH-SECRET-KEY` is the SSH secret key in the developer namespace for the supply chain to fetch source code from and push configuration to.
- `METADATA-STORE-URL-ON-VIEW-CLUSTER` references the URL of the Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Store deployed on the View cluster. For more information, see SCST - Store's [Ingress and multicluster support](../../scst-store/ingress-multicluster.html#scst-scan-install) for additional details.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you want to deploy the `ScanTemplates`.
This is the namespace where the scanning feature runs.
- `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the Secret that contains the
credentials to pull an image from the registry for scanning.

> **Note:** When you install Tanzu Application Platform, it is bootstrapped with the `lite`
> set of dependencies, including buildpacks and stacks, for application builds.
> For more information about buildpacks, see the [VMware Tanzu Buildpacks Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-index.html).
> You can find the buildpack and stack artifacts installed with Tanzu Application Platform
> on [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies).
> You can update dependencies by [upgrading Tanzu Application Platform](../../upgrading.md)
> to the latest patch, or
> by using an [automatic update process (deprecated)](../../tanzu-build-service/install-tbs.md#auto-updates-config).

> **Note:** The `scanning.metadatastore.url` must be set to an empty string if you're installing Grype Scanner v1.2.0 or later or Snyk Scanner to disable the embedded Supply Chain Security Tools - Store integration.
