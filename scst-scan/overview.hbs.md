# Overview of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic gives you an overview of use cases, features, and CVEs for Supply Chain Security Tools
(SCST) - Scan.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

With Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan, you can build and deploy
secure, trusted software that complies with your corporate security requirements.
SCST - Scan provides scanning and gatekeeping capabilities
that Application and DevSecOps teams can incorporate early in their path to
production. This is the best practice for reducing security risk
and ensuring more efficient remediation.

## <a id="use-cases"></a>Language support

For information about the languages and frameworks that are supported by Tanzu Application Platform
components, see the [Language and framework support in Tanzu Application Platform](../about-package-profiles.hbs.md#language-support) table.

## <a id="use-cases"></a>Use cases

The following use cases apply to SCST - Scan:

- Scan source code repositories and images for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) as
part of your software supply chain at build time.
- Scan container images produced by your supply chain and any running image in your Tanzu
Application Platform clusters for newly reported vulnerabilities after the initial image build scan.
- Use one of the available scan integrations or create your own to use your existing vulnerability scanning platforms.
- Analyze supply chain scan results against user-defined policies.
- Store vulnerability scan results in SCST - Store for long-term archival and reporting.

## <a id="scst-scan-feat"></a>SCST - Scan versions

There are two versions of SCST - Scan:

### SCST - Scan 1.0

SCST - Scan 1.0 has been in the testing and scanning supply chain since it was introduced with Tanzu
Application Platform v1.0. SCST - Scan 1.0 can scan a workload for vulnerabilities, submit the scan results
to SCST - Store for long-term storage and reporting, and compare the results against a policy
defined by the user. This is all included in a tightly coupled scan job that is executed as part of
the testing and scanning supply chain.

This tight coupling of the capabilities made it difficult to develop and maintain integrations for
the vast ecosystem of vulnerability scanning platforms. To simplify this integration process,
VMware introduced SCST - Scan 2.0.

Although other scan integrations are available, the default configuration for SCST - Scan 1.0 is the
open-source [Anchore Grype](https://anchore.com/opensource/).

### SCST - Scan 2.0

SCST - Scan 2.0 was introduced in the Tanzu Application Platform v1.5 release as an Alpha and is now
GA in Tanzu Application Platform v1.8. This iteration of SCST - Scan focuses on simplifying the
integration experience by decoupling SCST - Store submission and policy from the scanning task.
This allows integration to be simplified and more focused on the task of scanning workloads for vulnerabilities.

SCST - Scan 2.0 can scan container images after the initial creation of the workload. This allows you
to have visibility in the security posture of images as new vulnerabilities are reported.
For more information, see [Recurring Scanning](recurring-scanning.hbs.md). This capability can be
used with Scan 1.0 or Scan 2.0.

SCST - Scan 2.0 includes the default configuration to use open-source
[Aqua Security Trivy](https://www.aquasec.com/products/trivy/) as the image scanner, and a Grype
template is also included for backward compatibility. Examples of other integrations, and how to
build your own integration with this simplified interface, are provided in documentation.

### Determine which version to use

In Tanzu Application Platform v1.8, both SCST - Scan v1.0 and SCST - Scan v2.0 are supported. In a future release,
SCST - Scan v1.0 will be deprecated and replaced with SCST - Scan v2.0. To help facilitate this transition,
VMware is slowly making SCST - Scan 2.0 the default component. The default version varies depending on
the environment Tanzu Application Platform is installed on:

| Installation Environment | Default Component | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Online Installation](../install-online/intro.hbs.md) | SCST - Scan v1.0 | SCST - Scan v1.0 remains the default with the option to opt in to Scan 2.0. |
| [Offline Installation](../install-offline/intro.hbs.md) | SCST - Scan v2.0 | SCST - Scan v2.0 is the default due to a simplified air-gapped experience with Trivy. |
| [Azure Installation](../install-azure/intro.hbs.md)| SCST - Scan v1.0 | SCST - Scan v1.0 remains the default with the option to opt in to Scan v2.0. |
| [AWS Installation](../install-aws/intro.hbs.md)| SCST - Scan v1.0 | SCST - Scan v1.0 remains the default with the option to opt in to SCST - Scan v2.0. |

If you require a policy to block a workload in a supply chain based on detected vulnerabilities, use
SCST - Scan v1.0.

If you want to create a scan integration for a scan tool that does not exist, use SCST - Scan v2.0 as the
process is greatly simplified. For more information, see
[Bring your own scanner to use with Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan 2.0](./bring-your-own-scanner.hbs.md).

If you are using the Tanzu Supply Chain component, use SCST - Scan v2.0 as only SCST - Scan v2.0 is supported with
Tanzu Supply Chain. For more information, see [Overview of Tanzu Supply Chain](../supply-chain/about.hbs.md).

## <a id="scst-scan-note"></a>Vulnerability Scanner limitations

Although vulnerability scanning is an important practice in DevSecOps and
the benefits of it are widely recognized and accepted,
some limits impact its efficacy.
The following examples illustrate the limits that are prevalent in most scanners today:

### <a id="missed-cves"></a>Missed CVEs

One limit of all vulnerability scanners is that
no one tool can find all CVEs, which means there is a risk
that a missed CVE could be exploited. Some reasons for missed CVEs include:

- The scanner does not detect the vulnerability because it is a recently discovered vulnerability
and the CVE databases are not updated yet.
- The scanner verifies different CVE sources based on the detected package type and OS.
- The scanner might not fully support a particular programming language, packaging system, or
manifest format.
- The scanner might not implement binary analysis or fingerprinting.
- The detected component does not always include a canonical name and vendor, requiring the scanner
to infer and attempt fuzzy matching.
- When vendors register impacted software with NVD, the provided information might not exactly match
the values in the release artifacts.

#### <a id="false-positives"></a>False positives

Vulnerability scanners cannot always access the information to accurately identify whether a CVE
exists.
This often leads to an influx of false positives where the tool mistakenly flags something as a
vulnerability.
Unless you are specialized in security or are very familiar with a vulnerable component, assessing, and determining false positives is a
challenging and time-consuming activity. Some reasons for a false positive flag include:

- A component is misidentified due to similar names.
- A sub-component is identified as the parent component.
- A component is correctly identified but the impacted function is not on a reachable code path.
- A componentâ€™s impacted function is on a reachable code path but is not a concern due to the specific environment or configuration.
- The version of a component might be incorrectly flagged as impacted.
- The detected component does not always include a canonical name and vendor, requiring the scanner to infer and attempt fuzzy matching.

#### Mitigation measures

Although vulnerability scanning is not a perfect solution, it is an essential part
of the process for keeping your organization secure.
To maximize the benefits while minimizing the impact of the limits of vulnerability scanning, take the
following steps to scan more continuously and comprehensively to identify and remediate zero-day
vulnerabilities quickly:

- Scan early in the development cycle to ensure that you can address issues more efficiently. Tanzu Application Platform includes security practices such as source and container image vulnerability scanning earlier in the path to production for application teams.
- Scan any base images in use. Tanzu Application Platform image scanning can recognize and
scan the OS packages from a base image.
- Scan running software in test, stage, and production environments at a regular cadence.
- Generate accurate provenance at any level so that scanners have a complete picture of the dependencies to scan. This is where a software bill of materials (SBoM) is used. To help you automate this process, VMware Tanzu Build Service, leveraging Cloud Native Buildpacks, generates an SBoM for buildpack-based projects.
Because this SBoM is generated during the image-building stage, it is more accurate and complete than one generated earlier or later in the release life cycle. This is because it can highlight dependencies introduced at the time of build that might introduce the potential for compromise.
- Scan by using multiple scanners to maximize CVE coverage.
- Keep your dependencies up-to-date.
- To reduce the overall surface area of attack use smaller dependencies.
- Reduce the amount of third-party dependencies when possible.
- Use distroless base images when possible.
- Maintain a central record of false positives to ease CVE triaging and remediation efforts.
