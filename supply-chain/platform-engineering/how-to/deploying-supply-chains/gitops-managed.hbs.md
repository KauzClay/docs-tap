# Manage Supply Chains with GitOps

This topic tells you how to manage SupplyChains using GitOps.

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }}

SupplyChains, especially the authoring resources SupplyChain, Component, and Tekton Pipeline/Tekton Task, are delivered to clusters using a Git repository and GitOps source promotion style.

The expected flow is as follows:

1. Author the SupplyChain as a collection of YAML files in a file system backed by Git.
2. Test and debug by pushing all the files to a single namespace.
3. When you're happy with your new or modified SupplyChain, commit it to Git and create a pull request.
4. Using continuous integration, test, and approve the pull request.
5. Using continuous deployment, deliver your edits to build clusters.

>**Note** Both the integration and deployment of your SupplyChains should be managed by SupplyChains.
VMware will release examples of integration and delivery SupplyChains for SupplyChains in a future release.
