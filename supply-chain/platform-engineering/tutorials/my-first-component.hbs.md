# Build your first Component

This topic tells you how to build a Component using Tanzu Supply Chain.

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }}

## Prerequisite

- Ensure that you created a SupplyChain by following the tutorial [Build your first SupplyChain](./my-first-supply-chain.hbs.md).

## Getting started

In the first tutorial, we built a SupplyChain that retrieves the source code from a Git repository, and proceeds with building and
packaging it as a Carvel package. Subsequently, it initiates a pull request to transfer the Carvel
package to a GitOps repository, facilitating the installation of the built package on the Run clusters. 

In this tutorial, We will create a component that we can use in our supplychain for unit testing our Maven apps. 
We will create a component called `maven-unit-tester` and that will run unit tests on the source pulled by the `source-git-provider` stage.

```
tanzu supplychain component get source-git-provider-1.0.0 --show-details
```
Example: 
```
...
ðŸ“¤ Outputs
   git
    â”œâ”€ digest: $(resumptions.check-source.results.sha)
    â”œâ”€ type: git
    â””â”€ url: $(resumptions.check-source.results.url)
   source
    â”œâ”€ digest: $(pipeline.results.digest)
    â”œâ”€ type: source
    â””â”€ url: $(pipeline.results.url)
...
```

## Create a Tekton pipeline

The first step in creating a `Component` is to make a Tekton `Pipeline` that includes the logic the component will use. In our case, the `maven-unit-tester` does two things: it gets the source code extracted by the `source-git-provider` component and uses it as input. Then, it runs the unit test command on that source repository.

Our Tekton pipeline has 3 parts:

* Define the `parameters` that a Developer can provide using the Workload.
* Create a shared `workspace` to store intermediate files like the source code from the `source-git-provider` stage.
* Tasks that actually execute the unit testing logic.

### Step 1: Define Parameters
```
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
    name: maven-unit-tester-1.0.0
spec:
    description: Test maven application using mvn test command
    params:
      - description: url of source registry image
        name: source-url
        type: string
      - description: sub directory in source to become root dir for build
        name: sub-path
        default: "."
        type: string
      - description: The test command to run in my task
        name: testcmd
        type: string
      - description: The test command to run in my task
        name: workload-name
        type: string
```

### Step 2: Define a Tekton workspace

```
    workspaces:
      - name: shared-data
```

### Step 3: Add Tasks to the pipeline
We will add 2 tasks in the `Pipeline` resource.

* **Task 1:** will pull the output from source-git-provider and puts it in a workspace `shared-data` we defined in our pipeline above.
* **Task 2:** will run the unit tests and record the output as a Tekton Result.

```
    tasks:
      # task 1 pulls the output from source-git-provider and puts it in a workspace called shared-data
      - name: fetch-source
        params:
          - name: url
            value: $(params.source-url)
        taskRef:
          kind: Task
          name: fetch-tgz-content-oci
        workspaces:
          - name: store
            workspace: shared-data
            
      # task 2 runs the unit tests
      - name: test
        runAfter:
          - fetch-source
        params:
          - name: sub-path
            value: $(params.sub-path)
          - name: testcmd
            value: $(params.testcmd)
          - name: workload-name
            value: $(params.workload-name)
        taskSpec:
          params:
            - name: sub-path
            - name: testcmd
            - name: workload-name
          results:
            - description: Error message if things failed
              name: message
              type: string
          steps:
            - name: test
              image: maven
              env:
                - name: HOME
                  value: /tekton/home/
              script: |-
                #!/usr/bin/env sh
                set -eu
                ls -al $(workspaces.store.path)
                cd $(workspaces.store.path)/$(params.sub-path)

                set +e
                $(params.testcmd)
                testval=$?
                set -e

                if [ $testval -ne 0 ]; then
                  echo "Unit tests stage failed. Please run 'tanzu workload logs $(params.workload-name)' to see the run logs for more details." | tee "$(results.message.path)"
                  exit $testval
                fi
          stepTemplate:
              computeResources: {}
              securityContext:
                  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
                  capabilities:
                      drop:
                          - ALL
                  runAsNonRoot: true
                  runAsUser: 1001
                  seccompProfile:
                      type: RuntimeDefault
        workspaces:
          - name: store
            workspace: shared-data

```

>**Important** It is best practice to add the version of the pipeline in the name of the yaml file as well as the name of the pipeline so you can create new versions of the pipelines without interfearing with the old one. 

Put it all togather and our pipeline looks as follows and we will store our `Pipeline` in the `pipelines` folder created by the CLI as `maven-unit-tester-1.0.0.yaml`.

## Create a Supplychain Component

Next step is to write a `Component` manifest that defines the following 4 things:

* **Configuration:** for a `Component` that is exposed as part of the Developer API. These is the configuration that
    * Platform Engineer can override at a Supply chain level or
    * Developer can provide using the `Workload` if not overriden by a Platform Engineer at the `Supplychain` level.
* **Inputs/Outputs:**: 
    * `Inputs` is a list of named `Outputs` from a previous stage in a Supply chain that the current `Component` depends on.
    * `Outputs` are named outputs from this component that can be used by another `Component` as `Inputs`.
* **Pipeline Run Definition:** section defines the work done by this component. spec.pipelineRun is used to create a [Tekton PipelineRun] and has many similarities.


### Step 1: Define Component Configuration
```

apiVersion: supply-chain.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
    name: maven-unit-tester-1.0.0
spec:
    description: Execute a maven unit test command using the mvn CLI
    config:
        - path: spec.test.cmd
          schema:
            description: |
                Unit testing mvn command to run
            required:
                - cmd
            type: string
            default: "mvn test"
            example: "mvn test"
```

### Step 2: Define Component Inputs/Outputs

In our case, we will use the Output of the `source-git-provider` component as an input to our `maven-unit-tester` component.

```
    inputs:
      - name: source
        type: source
```

### Step 3: Define Component Pipeline Run Details

In this section, we will reference the `Pipeline` we created earlier and pass the values from the `Workload` and `Inputs` to satisfy the parameters for the Pipeline.

```
    pipelineRun:
        params:
            - name: source-url
              value: $(inputs.source.url)
            - name: sub-path
              value: $(workload.spec.source.subPath)
            - name: testcmd
              value: $(workload.spec.test.cmd)
            - name: workload-name
              value: $(workload.metadata.name)
        pipelineRef:
            name: maven-unit-tester-1.0.0
        taskRunTemplate:
            podTemplate:
                securityContext:
                    fsGroup: 1000
                    runAsGroup: 1000
                    runAsUser: 1001
        workspaces:
            - name: shared-data
              volumeClaimTemplate:
                spec:
                    accessModes:
                        - ReadWriteOnce
                    resources:
                        requests:
                            storage: 1Gi

```

Put it all togather and our `Component` looks as follows and we will store it in the `components` folder created by the CLI as `maven-unit-tester-1.0.0.yaml`. 

```

            default: "mvn test"
            example: "mvn test"

            - name: workload-name
              value: $(workload.metadata.name)
        pipelineRef:
            name: maven-unit-tester-1.0.0
        taskRunTemplate:
            podTemplate:
                securityContext:

                    runAsGroup: 1000
                    runAsUser: 1001
        workspaces:

              volumeClaimTemplate:
                spec:
                    accessModes:

                    resources:
                        requests:
                            storage: 1Gi
```

## Install the component

We can now use the `make install` target created by the `tanzu supplychain` CLI to install our new `Component` and `Pipeline` to see if they reconcile successfully. Errors thrown by Tekton will be caught by this command and will be displayed to the User.

```
NAMESPACE=mysupplychains make install
```

## Next Steps

Add your new `Component` to a `SupplyChain`. For instructions, see
[Add Stages to your Supply Chain](./add-stages-supply-chain.hbs.md).
