# Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan 2.0

This topic gives you an overview of Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan 2.0. Include this
component in your software supply chain to help identify vulnerabilities earlier in the development
life cycle. This helps to increase the security posture of your application.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

SCST - Scan 2.0 is the next-generation scanning framework for Tanzu Application Platform. It will
replace the [SCST - Scan component](overview.hbs.md) in a future release. It provides a framework
to scan workload components.

With SCST - Scan 2.0 you can:

- Scan container images for a workload that is built by the supply chain or provided as part of a
  workload definition for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
- Use your preferred container image-scan solution such as Anchore's Grype, Aqua's Trivy, Palo
  Alto's Prisma, and VMware Carbon Black Cloud.
- Post the scan results in an industry-standard format, such as [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/)
  or [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), as an OCI artifact to an OCI-compliant container image registry. By
  using industry standards, you do not need to be familiar with proprietary Tanzu Application
  Platform configurations.

### AMR Observer

The Tanzu Developer Portal dashboards for downstream services, such as
[Supply Chain Choreographer](../tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.hbs.md) and
[Security Analysis](../tap-gui/plugins/sa-tap-gui.hbs.md), depend on data being in the
[SCST - Store component](../scst-store/overview.hbs.md). Because pushing scan results to the
proprietary store endpoint is decoupled from the scan framework in SCST - Scan 2.0, AMR Observer
observes results pushed to a registry, parses the results, and pushes them to the SCST - Store
component.

For information about AMR observer, see [Overview of SCST â€“ Store](../scst-store/overview.hbs.md).

## <a id="supply-chain-usage"></a> Integrate with a supply chain

The SCST - Scan 2.0 component defines how to scan a container image with a scan solution by using
the generic Kubernetes custom resource `ImageVulnerabilityScan`. This provides a generic interface
that allows you to declare how the Tanzu Application Platform runs a scan on a container image for a
container image scan solution.

For [Cartographer](../scc/about.hbs.md) to stamp out an `ImageVulnerabilityScan` custom resource as
part of a supply chain execution, the `ImageVulnerabilityScan` must be wrapped in a
`ClusterImageTemplate` custom resource. This custom resource tells Cartographer not only how to
stamp out the `ImageVulnerabilityScan` template, but also what configurations are passed to it.
