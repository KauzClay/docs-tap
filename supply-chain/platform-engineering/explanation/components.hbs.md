# Overview of Components

This topic tells you about the `Component` resource in Tanzu Supply Chain.
For reference information, see [Component API](../../reference/api/component.hbs.md).

Components encapsulate the work to be done in composable and reusable pieces.
Components are analogous to steps, stages, jobs, and tasks in other CI/CD offerings.
Components are unique from other CI/CD offerings in three distinct ways:

1. Component configuration requirements are declared, static, and enforced.
  The configuration is used to build a `Workload` resource that is strongly-typed and well-documented.

2. Components are observed by users through a strict error-reporting API.

3. Components can exhibit re-entrant behavior. If you define a resumption for a component, the
   resumption can trigger new workload runs. This keeps the stored information about the component
   in transient dependencies within the component. For more information, see [Resumptions](resumptions.hbs.md).

These design constraints exist to:

1. Simplify the end-user experience: Provides a single, well-defined API and a way of mitigating
   errors if they arise.

2. Simplify the authoring experience: Requires minimal Kubernetes experience to construct
   supply chains that meet your organization's needs.
