# Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan 2.0 with Tanzu Supply Chain (Beta)

This topic gives you an overview of using Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan 2.0 with Tanzu
Supply Chain (Beta). This topic is only applicable if you are evaluating the beta release of Tanzu
Supply Chain.

## <a id="supply-chain-usage"></a> Integrating into a Tanzu Supply Chain

The SCST - Scan 2.0 component defines how to scan a container image with a scan solution by using
the generic Kubernetes custom resource `ImageVulnerabilityScan`. This provides a generic interface
that allows you to declare how Tanzu Application Platform runs a scan on a container image for a
container image scan solution.

To run an `ImageVulnerabilityScan` in a [Tanzu Supply Chain](../../supply-chain/about.hbs.md):

- [Construct a Supply Chain using the Tanzu CLI](../../supply-chain/platform-engineering/how-to/supply-chain-authoring/construct-with-cli.hbs.md).
- [Create a Workload](../../supply-chain/development/how-to/discover-workloads.hbs.md).
