# Install the Tanzu Build Service dependencies

This topic tells you how to install the Tanzu Build Service (TBS) full dependencies
on Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

## <a id='full-deps'></a> Install full dependencies

>**Important** By default, Tanzu Build Service is installed with `lite` dependencies.

When installing Tanzu Build Service in an air-gapped environment, the `lite` dependencies
are not available because they require Internet access.
You must install the `full` dependencies.

To install `full` dependencies:

<!-- The below partial is in the docs-tap/partials directory -->

{{> 'partials/tanzu-build-service/full-deps' }}

## <a id='auto-deps-update'></a> (Optional) Update dependencies out of band of Tanzu Application Platform releases

{{> 'partials/tanzu-build-service/auto-deps' initial_steps="1. Relocate the dependency updater package repository to the air-gapped container image registry:

    - If a machine with access to both the air-gapped registry and the internet is available, you can
    copy the images directly by running:

        ```console
        imgpkg copy \
          -b tanzu.packages.broadcom.com/build-service-dependency-updater/package-repo:VERSION-CONSTRAINT \
          --to-repo INTERNAL-REPO
        ```

        Where:

        - `VERSION-CONSTRAINT` is the Tanzu Application Platform version in the form of `MAJOR.MINOR.x`.
          For example, `1.8.x`.
        - `INTERNAL-REPO` is your repository in the air-gapped container image registry. Examples:
            - Harbor has the form `MY-REGISTRY/REPO-NAME/tbs-dep-updater`.
            - Docker Hub has the form `MY-REGISTRY/tbs-dep-updater`.
            - Google Cloud Registry has the form `MY-REGISTRY/MY-PROJECT/REPO-NAME/tbs-dep-updater`.

    - If you can only transfer the data using a physical external storage device:

        1. Copy the images into a `.tar` file from `tanzu.packages.broadcom.com` by running:

            ```console
            imgpkg copy \
              -b tanzu.packages.broadcom.com/build-service-dependency-updater/package-repo:VERSION-CONSTRAINT \
              --to-tar dependency-updater-VERSION-CONSTRAINT.tar \
              --include-non-distributable-layers
            ```

            Where `VERSION-CONSTRAINT` is the Tanzu Application Platform version in the form of `MAJOR.MINOR.x`.
            For example, `1.8.x`.

        1. Import the `.tar` files into the air-gapped container image registry by running:

            ```console
            imgpkg copy \
              --tar dependency-updater-VERSION-CONSTRAINT.tar \
              --to-repo INTERNAL-REPO \
              --include-non-distributable-layers \
              --registry-ca-cert-path $REGISTRY_CA_PATH
            ```

            Where:

            - `VERSION-CONSTRAINT` is the Tanzu Application Platform version in the form of `MAJOR.MINOR.x`.
              For example, `1.8.x`.
            - `INTERNAL-REPO` is your repository in the air-gapped container image registry. Examples:
                - Harbor has the form `MY-REGISTRY/REPO-NAME/tbs-dep-updater`.
                - Docker Hub has the form `MY-REGISTRY/tbs-dep-updater`.
                - Google Cloud Registry has the form `MY-REGISTRY/MY-PROJECT/REPO-NAME/tbs-dep-updater`.
