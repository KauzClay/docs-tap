# Configure an ImageVulnerabilityScan for Snyk

This topic gives you an example of how to configure a secret and `ImageVulnerabilityScan` (IVS) for
Snyk.

## <a id="secret-example"></a> Example Secret

This section contains a sample secret containing the Snyk API token, which authenticates your Snyk
account. You must apply this once to your developer namespace.

> **Important** For the publicly available Snyk scanner CLI image, CLI commands and parameters used
> are accurate at the time of documentation.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: snyk-token
stringData:
  snyk: |
    {"api": "SNYK-API-TOKEN"}
```

Where `SNYK-API-TOKEN` is your Snyk API token obtained by following the instructions in the
[Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/authenticate-the-cli-with-your-account). Do not
encode this value in base64.

## <a id="example"></a> Example `ImageVulnerabilityScan`

This section contains a sample IVS that uses Snyk to scan a targeted image and push the results to
the specified registry location. For information about the IVS specification, see
[Configuration options](ivs-create-your-own.hbs.md#img-vuln-config-options).

Sample IVS:

```yaml
apiVersion: app-scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ImageVulnerabilityScan
metadata:
  name: snyk-ivs
  annotations:
    app-scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/scanner-name: Snyk
spec:
  image: TARGET-IMAGE
  scanResults:
    location: registry/project/scan-results
  serviceAccountNames:
    publisher: publisher
    scanner: scanner
  workspace:
    bindings:
    - name: snyk
      secret:
        secretName: snyk-token
        items:
          - key: snyk
            path: configstore/snyk.json
  steps:
  - name: snyk
    image: SNYK-SCANNER-IMAGE
    env:
    - name: XDG-CONFIG-HOME
      value: /snyk
    command: ["snyk","container","test",$(params.image),"--json-file-output=$(params.scan-results-path)/scan.json"]
    onError: continue
  - name: snyk2spdx # You will need to create your own image. See explanation below.
    image: SNYK2SPDX-IMAGE
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args:
      - "-c"
      - |
        set -e
        cat $(params.scan-results-path)/scan.json | /app/bin/snyk2spdx --output=$(params.scan-results-path)/scan.spdx.json
```

Where:

- `TARGET-IMAGE` is the image to be scanned. You must specify the digest.
- `SNYK-SCANNER-IMAGE` is the image containing the Snyk CLI. For example, `snyk/snyk:golang`. For
  information about publicly available Snyk images, see
  [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk). For more information about using the Snyk CLI,
  see the [Snyk documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli).
- `XDG-CONFIG-HOME` is the directory that contains your Snyk CLI configuration file,
  `configstore/snyk.json`, which is populated using the `snyk-token` secret that you created. For
  more information, see the
  [Snyk Config documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/config).
- `SNYK2SPDX-IMAGE` is the image used to convert the Snyk CLI output `scan.json` in the `snyk` step
  to SPDX format, and insert the missing `DOCUMENT DESCRIBES` relation. For more information, see
  the Snyk [snyk2spdx repository](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk2spdx) in GitHub.

To use the sample:

1. Clone the [snyk2spdx repository](https://github.com/snyk-tech-services/snyk2spdx).
1. Add the following Dockerfile to the root of the repository by running:

   ```console
   FROM node AS build

   RUN npm install -g typescript
   RUN npm install -g ts-node

   WORKDIR /build-dir
   ADD . .

   RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   RUN npm run build && npm prune --json --omit=dev --legacy-peer-deps
   RUN npx nexe@3.3.7 dist/index.js  -r './dist/**/*.js' -t linux-x64-12.16.2 -o snyk2spdx-linux

   FROM paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-base AS run

   COPY --from=build /build-dir/dist/ /app/dist/
   COPY --from=build /build-dir/node_modules /app/node_modules
   COPY --from=build /build-dir/snyk2spdx-linux /app/bin/snyk2spdx

   ENTRYPOINT ["/app/bin/snyk2spdx"]
   CMD ["/app/bin/snyk2spdx"]
   ```

1. Build and push the image to a registry. Replace `SNYK2SPDX-IMAGE` with the new image you built.

   The `snyk2spdx` output does not conform to the
   [verification process](verify-app-scanning-supply-chain.hbs.md). Although the results might be
   ingested to the Tanzu Application Platform Metadata Store, VMware does not ensure the accuracy of
   the results.

> **Note** After detecting vulnerabilities, the Snyk image exits with Exit Code 1 and causes a
> failed scan task. You can ignore the step error by setting `onError` and handling the error in a
> subsequent step. For instructions, see the
> [Tekton documentation](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#specifying-onerror-for-a-step).

For information about setting up scanner credentials, see the
[Snyk CLI documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/config).
