# Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) data model and concepts

This topic tells you about data models used in the Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR).

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The following diagram shows the data models used in the AMR to store artifact information and the relationship between them.

## <a id='amr-data-models'></a> AMR data models

The following data models are stored in the AMR:

- `Locations` (alpha)
- `Containers`
- `Images`
- `Commits`
- `AppAcceleratorRuns` (alpha)
- `AppAcceleratorFragments` (alpha)
- `DoraMetrics` (alpha)
- `DoraMetricsPerCorrelationID` (alpha)

### <a id='locations'></a> Locations (alpha)

The `Locations` data model stores data about the locations that `Apps` are
deployed on, like clusters. It stores data using:

- `reference`: unique reference to the location. It is automatically set to be
  the `kube-system` namespace UID by the AMR. You can't configure this value.
- `labels`: labels of the location. You can add labels in the `tap-values.yaml`
  file. See [AMR Configuration](configuration.hbs.md).

### <a id='containers'></a> Containers

The `Containers` data model includes information about a container, like runtime
information about an image. The Observer sends this information to the Cloud
Event Handler. Each entry represents the state of the container when an event
occurred, such as when a container runs or stops. This lets you see the
history of your containers.

Each `Container` data entry stores information about the associated deployment
location, details about the state, and what image was used. You can only
associate a `Containers` entry with one `Locations` entry. You can point
multiple `Containers` entries to the same `Locations` entry.

### <a id='images'></a> Images

The `Images` data model includes information about image which acts as a
template for containers. The Observer sends this information to the Cloud Event
Handler to store newly generated images.

Each `Image` data entry stores information about the associated deployment
location. You can only associate an `Images` entry with one `Locations` entry.
You can point multiple `Images` entries to the same `Locations` entry.

### <a id='commits'></a> Commits

The `Commits` data model includes information about a snapshot of the changes
made to a project's files. The Observer sends this information to the Cloud
Event Handler to store new commits.

Each `Commit` data entry stores information about the deployment location,
details about the state, and what commit `sha` or `tag` were used. You can only
associate a `Commits` entry with one `Locations` entry. You can point multiple
`Commits` entries to the same `Locations` entry.

### <a id='appacceleratorruns'></a> AppAcceleratorRuns (alpha)

The `AppAcceleratorRuns` data model represents new projects running from Git
repositories. An `accelerator.yaml` file in the repository declares input
options for the accelerator. This file contains instructions for processing the
files when you generate a new project. Observer sends this information to the
CloudEvent Handler to store `AppAcceleratorRuns`.

Each `AppAcceleratorRun` data entry has a unique `guid`. The `guid` includes information
about the Git repository including, `AppAcceleratorRepoURL`, `AppAcceleratorRevision`,
and `AppAcceleratorSubpath`. You can point multiple `AppAcceleratorFragments` entries
to the same `AppAcceleratorRun` entry. You can also associate an `AppAcceleratorRun`
with one `AppAcceleratorSource`, also known as `Commit`.

### <a id='appacceleratorfragments'></a> AppAcceleratorFragments (alpha)

The `AppAcceleratorFragments` Accelerator fragments are reusable accelerator
components that can provide options, files, or transforms. You can import
accelerators using an `import` entry. An `InvokeFragment` transform references
the transforms from the fragment in the accelerator that declares the import.
The AppAcceleratorFragments data model represents the information of a fragment
in the accelerator app. The Observer sends this information to the Cloud Event
Handler to store `AppAcceleratorFragments`.

Each `AppAcceleratorFragment` data entry stores information about source Git repository:
`AppAcceleratorFragmentSourceRepoURL`, `AppAcceleratorFragmentSourceRevision`, and
`AppAcceleratorFragmentSourceSubpath`. You can associate an `AppAcceleratorFragment` to
an `AppAcceleratorRun`. You can point a `AppAcceleratorFragmentSource`
(also known as `Commit`) to one `AppAcceleratorFragment`.

### <a id='doraMetrics'></a> DoraMetrics (alpha)

The `DoraMetrics` data model represents the DORA Metric information. The Observer sends
this information to the CloudEvent Handler to store `DoraMetrics`.

`AggregatedLeadTime` is a velocity metric that describes the median amount of time in seconds for a
commit to deploy to an environment. `AggregatedDeployments` describes how frequently
a team releases to production in a time range. You can point multiple
`DoraMetricsPerCorrelationID` to one `DoraMertric`.

### <a id='metrics-correlation-ID'></a> DoraMetricsPerCorrelationID (alpha)

The `DoraMetricsPerCorrelationID` data model represents the information of DORA Metric for
a Correlation ID. The Correlation ID groups the all the artifacts together. The
Observer sends this information to the CloudEvent Handler to store
`DoraMetricsPerCorrelationID`.
