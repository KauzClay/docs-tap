# Output types for catalog components

This section describes the common types established in Tanzu Supply Chain Components, their purpose
and their structure. Use this as a guide to consuming or emitting types from your own custom Components.

## conventions

**URL**: OCI image containing the `app-config.yaml` file
**Digest**: OCI image digest

This output image contains a single file: `app-config.yaml`. The `template` field in this file
contains a Kubernetes Pod Template Spec, decorated by the Conventions controller. The Conventions
component can also copy the settings in the configurations `spec.env` into the Pod template's `env`
field.

## git

**URL**: The source code Git repository URL
**Digest**: The source code git commit SHA

## git-pr

**URL**: URL of the pull request
**Digest**: SHA digest of the pull request commit

Output for a Git pull request.

## image

- **URL**: OCI image URL for the image built with kpack
- **Digest**: OCI image digest

An OCI image containing the app built with kpack.

## oci-yaml-files

- **URL**: An OCI image containing Kubernetes resource(s) as YAML files
- **Digest**: OCI image digest

The resources in this OCI image can be applied to a cluster with no modifications.

The purpose of this OCI image type is to provide the raw Kubernetes resources required to deploy an
application onto a cluster.

## oci-ytt-files

- **URL**: An OCI image containing files written in the [ytt](https://carvel.dev/ytt) templating
  language.
- **Digest**: OCI image digest

The files in this OCI image cannot be applied to a cluster, and are intended to be combined with
Kubernetes resources from oci-yaml-files.

The purpose of this OCI image type is to provide the ytt Values Schema and Overlays that make a
Carvel Package configurable. Separating the ytt files from the raw Kubernetes resources makes the
app-config-* components more generally useful.

If a Supply Chain author wanted to create a Supply Chain that simply deploys the raw Kubernetes YAML
files created by the app-config-* components, instead of putting them into a Carvel Package, they
could write a component that takes the input oci-yaml-files, and not the input oci-ytt-files.

## package

- **URL**: An OCI image containing a Carvel Package, PackageInstall, and Values YAML file
- **Digest**: OCI image digest

The resources in this OCI image can either be deployed to a cluster, or written to a Git repository
for use in a GitOps workflow.

The purpose of this OCI image type is to contain a single version of an application as a Carvel
Package, as well as the PackageInstall and Values YAML necessary to deploy the Package.

## source

- **URL**: OCI image containing the Git repository source code
- **Digest**: OCI image digest

An OCI image containing the source code retrieved from a Git repository.
