# Expose HTTP server workloads outside the cluster manually

You can expose HTTP `server` workloads outside the cluster by creating an Ingress resource and using
cert-manager to provision TLS-signed certificates. To do so:

1. Using the `spring-sensors-consumer-web` workload from
   [Bind an application workload to the service instance](../../getting-started/consume-services.hbs.md#stk-bind)
   as an example, create the following `Ingress`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: spring-sensors-consumer-web
      namespace: DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE
      annotations:
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: tap-ingress-selfsigned
        ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: contour
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    spec:
      tls:
        - secretName: spring-sensors-consumer-web
          hosts:
            - "spring-sensors-consumer-web.INGRESS-DOMAIN"
      rules:
        - host: "spring-sensors-consumer-web.INGRESS-DOMAIN"
          http:
            paths:
              - pathType: Prefix
                path: /
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: spring-sensors-consumer-web
                    port:
                      number: 8080
    ```

   - Replace `DEVELOPER-NAMESPACE` with your developer namespace.
   - Replace `INGRESS-DOMAIN` with the domain name defined in `tap-values.yaml` during the
     installation.
   - Set the annotation `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` to the `shared.ingress_issuer` value
     configured during installation or leave it as `tap-ingress-selfsigned` to use the default
     value.
   - Update the port exposed by your `Service` resource, which is set as `8080` in the example.

1. Access the `server` workload with HTTPS by running:

   ```console
   curl -k https://spring-sensors-consumer-web.INGRESS-DOMAIN
   ```
