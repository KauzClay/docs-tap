# Migrate Spring Config Server apps to Tanzu Application Platform

Tanzu Application Service (commonly known as TAS) and Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP)
both enable you to load Java properties into an app from a configuration repository.

You can migrate an app running on TAS with Spring Configuration Service (SCS) to Tanzu Application
Platform with Application Configuration Service (ACS).

This migration does not require changes to the app code or the configuration repository
where properties are stored. However, the mechanism for loading properties into a Tanzu Application
Platform workload is quite different and requires a substantially different setup.

At a high level SCS and ACS operate as follows:

- SCS instances run as web apps serving configuration by using REST requests. TAS apps bound to SCS
  instances fetch configuration using an autowired `ConfigServerConfigDataLoader` bean and add it to
  the app properties.

- ACS `ConfigurationServer` instances are Kubernetes custom resources, reconciled by a controller
  manager. These resources are wired into Tanzu Application Platform workloads using a
  `ConfigurationSlice` object. Each `ConfigurationSlice` creates a bindable secret object containing
  properties, which is mounted to the app file system and loaded into the Spring app from there.

This topic uses the [cook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook) sample app to
demonstrate how to migrate.

## <a id="deploy-app-to-tas"></a> Deploy the `cook` app to Tanzu Application Service

This section describes, at a high level, the steps for deploying an example `cook` app on Tanzu Application Service.

To deploy the app:

1. Create an SCS instance that points to the
   [cook-config GitHub repository](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config) by
   running:

   ```console
   cf create-service -c '{ "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config", \
   "label": "main"  } }' ${service_name} standard cook-config-server
   ```

1. Run `cf push` to push the app to TAS with an app manifest that binds to the service instance:

    ```yaml
    ---
    applications:
      - name: cook
        host: cookie
        instances: 1
        memory: 1G
        services:
          - cook-config-server
        env:
          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: development
          JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { version: 17.+ }}'
    ```

For more detailed instructions, see the
[README](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/blob/main/README.adoc) file.

## <a id="migrate-tas-to-tap"></a> Migrate from TAS to Tanzu Application Platform

This section describes the areas to translate when creating a Tanzu Application Platform workload
that will deploy the same app.

### <a id="create-cnfg-srvr-instance"></a> Create a Config Server instance

TAS/SCS
: Create a service instance by running `cf create-service`, specifying the URI and label (branch) of
  the `cook-config` repository in the configuration JSON:

   ```console
   cf create-service -c '{ "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config", \
   "label": "main"  } }' p.config-server standard cook-config-server
   ```

Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
: Create a `ConfigurationSource` resource, specifying the location of the `cook-config` repository in
  the `spec.backends` property. For detailed options, see the
  [ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.3/acs/GUID-gettingstarted-configuringworkloads.html#create-a-configuration-source).

### <a id="spec-app-name-profiles"></a> Specify the app name and Spring profiles

TAS/SCS
: To specify the app name and Spring profiles:

   1. Specify the app name is specified in the `spring.application.name` property. For the
      `cook` app this is found in [application.yml](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.yml).

   1. Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the `env` key in the app
      manifest to designate profiles. Multiple entries must be comma-separated.

Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
: To specify the app name and Spring profiles:

   1. Create a `ConfigurationSlice` resource, specifying the name of the `ConfigurationSource`
      resource in the `spec.configurationSource` property.

   1. Create one or more entries in the `spec.content` array property of the `ConfigurationSlice`
      resource with the format `APP-NAME/PROFILE-NAME/OPTIONAL-LABEL` where:

      - `APP-NAME` is the app name.
      - `PROFILE-NAME` is the profile name.
      - `OPTIONAL-LABEL` is an optional comma-separated list of labels from which to retrieve properties.

  For more information, see the
  [ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.3/acs/GUID-crds-configurationslice.html#configurationslice-content).

### <a id="bind-cnfg-srvr-to-app"></a> Bind the Config Server to the app

TAS/SCS
: To bind the Config Server to the app, either add the service-instance name in the services key in
  the app manifest, or run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to the app.

Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
: To bind the Config Server to the app:

   1. Create a `ResourceClaim` resource, specifying the details of the `ConfigurationSlice` resource
      in the `spec.ref` section of the configuration.
   1. Specify the `ResourceClaim` resource in the `spec.serviceClaims` section of the workload. This
      mounts the properties to the running podâ€™s file system.
   1. Specify a `SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT` property in the `spec.env` section of the workload with the
      value `optional:configtree:${SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT}/CLAIM-NAME/`, where `CLAIM-NAME` is the name
      you specified in the `spec.serviceClaims` list.

      This environment variable tells the Spring runtime to pull properties from the file system at
      the path where the `serviceClaims` mechanism mounted them. For more information, see
      [ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.3/acs/GUID-gettingstarted-configuringworkloads.html#using-configuration-in-a-workload).
