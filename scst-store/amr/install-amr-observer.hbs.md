# Artifact Metadata Repository Observer for Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

This topic tells you how to install Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) Observer for Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Store.

## <a id='prerecs'></a> Prerequisites

The AMR Observer is deployed by default on the Tanzu Application Platform Full, Build and Run profiles.

## <a id='switch-context'></a> Switching Context

If Artifact Metadata Repository Observer is installed on a separate cluster from AMR CloudEvent Handler, you must ensure that the correct cluster is targeted before updating package values.

```console
# 1. Switch context to cluster with AMR Observer
kubectl config use-context OBSERVER-CLUSTER-NAME

# 2. Update the tap-values.yaml in an editor according to the desired configuration

# 3. Update the installed TAP package on the cluster
tanzu package installed update tap --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
```

Where `OBSERVER-CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the cluster you want to use.

## <a id='install'></a> Configuring AMR Observer in a multicluster deployment

When you install AMR Observer on a different cluster from the AMR CloudEvent
Handler, the following values are required:

- `amr.observer.cloudevent_handler.endpoint` is required for the Observer to send to the AMR CloudEvent Handler.
- `amr.observer.cloudevent_handler.ca_cert_data` or `shared.ca_cert_data` are required for AMR CloudEvent Handlers that use Custom CA certificates to generate the associated TLS certificate for the ingress endpoint.

>**Note** If SCST - Scan 2.0 is installed after AMR Observer has already been deployed, a deployment you must restart AMR Observer to observe the new ImageVulnerabilityScan Custom Resource that was installed with SCST - Scan 2.0.

```console
kubectl -n amr-observer-system rollout restart deployment amr-observer-controller-manager
```

The following log appears if the AMR Observer is observing the ImageVulnerabilityScan Custom Resource:

```log
2023-06-28T17:56:43Z  INFO  Starting Controller  {"controller": "imagevulnerabilityscan", "controllerGroup": "app-scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com", "controllerKind": "ImageVulnerabilityScan"}
```

For information about logging, see [Troubleshoot - AMR Observer Logs](./troubleshooting.hbs.md#amr-observer-logs).

See [Configuration - AMR Observer](./configuration.hbs.md#amr-observer).

## <a id='standalone-install'></a> Installing Artifact Metadata Repository Observer Standalone

1. To install AMR Observer standalone from a Tanzu Application Platform profile, verify the available version:
  
  ```console
  $ tanzu package available list amr-observer.apps.tanzu.vmware.com -n tap-install

    NAME                                VERSION        RELEASED-AT
    amr-observer.apps.tanzu.vmware.com  0.2.0          2023-10-05 16:17:22 -0400 EDT
  ```

1. Look at the package values-schema to create the values file. For more
   information, see [Configuration](./configuration.hbs.md#Configuration).
  
  ```console
  $ tanzu package available get amr-observer.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/0.2.0 --values-schema --namespace tap-install
