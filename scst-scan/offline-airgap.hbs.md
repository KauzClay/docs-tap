# Use vulnerability scanning in offline and air-gapped environments for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic tells you how to use Grype in air-gapped (offline) environments for Supply Chain Security
Tools (SCST) - Scan.

> **Note** For air-gapped (offline) environments, VMware recommends using Aqua Security's Trivy
> scanner with Scan 2.0. This greatly simplifies the installation and maintenance experiences
> compared to using Anchore Grype and Scan 1.0. For more information about how Scan 2.0 compares to
> Scan 1.0, see
> [Overview of SCST - Scan](overview.hbs.md).
