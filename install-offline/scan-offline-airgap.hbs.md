# Use vulnerability scanning in offline and air-gapped environments

For air-gapped (offline) environments, VMware recommends using Aqua Security's Trivy scanner with
Scan 2.0. Trivy scanner with Scan 2.0 greatly simplifies the installation and maintenance
experiences over Anchore Grype and Scan 1.0. For a comparison of Scan 1.0 and Scan 2.0, see
[Overview of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](../scst-scan/overview.hbs.md).
