# Overview of Tanzu Supply Chain

Tanzu Supply Chain is a tool that provides a golden path to production for your teams.
It replaces the existing supply chain solution [Supply Chain Choreographer](../scc/about.hbs.md)
which is based on [Cartographer](https://cartographer.sh).

## Beta status

Tanzu Supply Chain is early access beta software and is likely to change based on
user feedback.

It is not intended for production environments, and VMware cannot guarantee compatibility or
migration support between Tanzu Application Platform v1.8 and future versions.

## Documentation structure

The Tanzu Supply Chain documentation is organized into the following sections:

- [Platform Engineering with Supply Chain](./platform-engineering/about.hbs.md): For platform
engineers that want to author supply chains that simplify developer cognitive load, and ensure
compliant, secure delivery of source to production.
- [Developing software with Supply Chain](./development/about.hbs.md): For developers that want
to deliver their software following team and organization standards.
